        <h4>Description of Design Decisions</h4>
        
        <p>For our design, we wanted our theme to be Centre College. We envisioned an interface that was easy to navigate through while still maintaining a consistant theme of a Centre College class webpage. Thanks to a helpful tip we recieved during Tuesday's class, we were able to consult the Centre Visual Guide for tips on how to make our site look like it had a Centre College aesthetic. We wanted the main page to have a header that was interactive, while also being constantly accessable at every part of the site, therefore, we decided to make the header fixed. We placed the profile picture on the right side to balance out the header, which has the Centre College logo on the opposing side. Overall, we wanted the site to maintain the look of balance. We tried to prevent the website from having too many objects on one side of screen over the other. We thought the best way to maintain balance was to try and orient the objects on the site towards the center of the screen, hopefully establishing a smooth flow between tabs as the user is browsing. </p>
